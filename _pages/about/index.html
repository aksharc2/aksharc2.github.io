My research focuses on developing algorithms to maximize the battery lifespan of autonomous systems, which I implement and test on autonomous mobile robots.</p> <p>I hold a Master’s of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Wayne State University (2020), where I collaborated with Dr. Murat Yildirim in the Cyber-Physical Analytics Lab, focusing on opportunistic maintenance scheduling of connected vehicles. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mumbai, India (2014), and also hold a Diploma in Automobile Engineering (2011). My diverse educational background gives me a practical understanding of various engineering fields, which I use to enhance the performance of cyber-physical systems like autonomous robots.</p> </body></html>
