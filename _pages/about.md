<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University, supervised by <a href='https://u.osu.edu/brocanelli1/'>Dr. Marco Brocanelli</a>. My research is dedicated to developing algorithms aimed at optimizing the battery lifespan of autonomous systems. Specifically, I focus on developing algorithms that not only enhance the operational efficiency of these systems but also extend their overall battery longevity. I validate and refine these algorithms through rigorous testing on autonomous mobile robots, where real-world conditions provide crucial insights into their practical effectiveness.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I earned a Master's of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Wayne State University (2020). During my time there, I collaborated with <a href='https://engineering.wayne.edu/profile/gr7140'>Dr. Murat Yildirim</a> in the Cyber-Physical Analytics Lab, where our research centered on opportunistic maintenance scheduling for connected vehicles.</p>

<p>My academic journey in engineering began with a Diploma in Automobile Engineering in 2011, which provided me with practical skills and a strong foundation in vehicle mechanics. Building on that foundation, I later earned a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mumbai in 2014. This combination of hands-on training and academic knowledge has given me a comprehensive understanding of engineering principles. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I accumulated 3.5 years of teaching experience as a Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, including roles at <a href='https://gpthane.org.in/'>Government Polytechnic Thane</a> and <a href='https://www.sjcem.edu.in/eng-diploma/'>St. John College of Engineering and Management</a>.</p>


<p>My diverse educational background equips me with a practical understanding across various engineering disciplines, enhancing my ability to optimize the performance of cyber-physical systems such as autonomous robots.</p>
