I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University, under the guidance of Dr. Marco Brocanelli. My research focuses on developing algorithms to maximize the battery lifespan of autonomous systems, which I implement and test on autonomous mobile robots.

I hold a Master's of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Wayne State University (2020), where I collaborated with Dr. Murat Yildirim in the Cyber-Physical Analytics Lab, focusing on opportunistic maintenance scheduling of connected vehicles. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mumbai, India (2014), and also hold a Diploma in Automobile Engineering (2011). My diverse educational background gives me a practical understanding of various engineering fields, which I use to enhance the performance of cyber-physical systems like autonomous robots.
