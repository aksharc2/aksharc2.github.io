Excited to share that the abstract for 'Rethinking Energy Management for Autonomous Ground Robots on a Budget' has been selected for a poster presentation at the 2025 [Edward F. Hayes Advanced Research Forum](https://cgs.osu.edu/programs-events/edward-f-hayes-advanced-research-forum) at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. Looking forward to presenting our research!
